# Molma

A text adventure in javascript. Master branch contains the demo (see gitpages), rewrite branch contains the WIP actual game and additional features.

## Setup
A former slicer lives a quiet life in a cyberpunk dystopia. The world is ravaged by rising sea levels, and subnautical hubstations built in response participate in yearly blackouts. Only this time, one of the stations does not come back on the grid. Something lurks in the depths.

## Planned Features

In addition to working on the story and gameplay, there are additional features planned:

* A better input method
* Audio events
* Dynamic background colors/gradients
* Mobile support OR Electron implementation
* Travis CI selenium tests
